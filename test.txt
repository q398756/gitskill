oh if there is one thing to be taught,
this dreams are made to be caught,
and friends can never be bought,
doesn't matter how long it's been,
i know you'll always jump in,
cause we don't know how to quit.

Let's start a riot tonight,
a pack of lions tonight,
In this world  he who stop,
won't get anything he wants.
Play like the top 1% 
till nothing's left to be spent,
take it all ours to take
Celebrate because
we are the champion.
Setting it off again.
oh we on fire, we on fire.
running our own campaign,
doing the whole shebang
oh we on fire, we on fire.
get up
stand up
throw your hands up
welcome to the other land of dreamers
brothers, sisters, others.
yeah 
we on fire like that
oh the bone is deeper than skin
the kind of club that we're in
the kind of love that we give
oh ever since the dawn of the mankind
we all belong to a tribe
it's good to know this one's mind
Let's start a riot tonight,
a pack of lions tonight,
In this world  he who stop,
won't get anything he wants.
Play like the top 1% 
till nothing's left to be spent,
we don't care
we don't stop
call your mothers 
call the cops
